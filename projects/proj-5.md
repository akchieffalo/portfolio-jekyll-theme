title: 'About Me'

Hey folks! I'm Alexander Chieffalo, originally from Texas, currently calling London home, but soon to make the leap down under to Australia to continue my journey with Eightcap, a leading CFD broker. When I'm not crunching numbers or analyzing markets, you'll likely find me cheering on my beloved Dallas Cowboys and Dallas Mavericks, or perhaps hitting the tennis court for a friendly match. Whether it's discussing the latest NFL or NBA game or diving into the intricacies of financial markets, I'm always up for a chat. Let's connect and share our passion for sports, finance, and everything in between!
