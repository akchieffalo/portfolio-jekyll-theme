Hey there! I'm Alexander Chieffalo, originally from Texas and a huge fan of NFL, NBA, and Tennis. You'll often find me cheering on my favorite teams, the Dallas Cowboys and the Dallas Mavericks. With a background in finance and data analytics, I've had the opportunity to work with companies like Eightcap and Openpayd, where I've honed my skills in risk analysis and compliance. When I'm not crunching numbers, you can catch me enjoying a game, travelling the world or playing Tennis. Let's connect and talk sports or financeâ€”or both!
